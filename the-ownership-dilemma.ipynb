If you haven't read it yet, I would recommend to start [here](https://www.mentorskool.com/learnbook/making-sense-of-cloud)\n","\n","In this learnbook we'll understand :\n","\n","*How Cloud helps controlling Total Cost of Ownership for IT transformation projects?*\n","\n","<hr style=\"height:1px;border-width:0;color:#cfcfcf;background-color:#cfcfcf\">\n","\n","Let's do a role play to understand the problem better. \n","\n","#### <font color=\"019aff\">The Problem Statement</font>\n","\n","Your client wants to have the discussion on TCO of the IT project. Based on that they would like to understand how Cloud can help them keep the TCO low. Can they reduce CAPEX? How about OPEX? Will cloud help them regulate that too?\n","\n","<hr style=\"height:1px;border-width:0;color:#cfcfcf;background-color:#cfcfcf\">\n","\n","#### <font color=\"019aff\">How did we solve it?</font>\n","\n","To be able to suggest a viable answer, it is important to understand **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)** first.  \n","\n","In the world of **IT**, the term **TOC** or **Total Cost of Ownership** is very commonly used term when it comes to estimating the **full cost** of **implementing** and **maintaining** a given digital transformation project. \n","\n","Read more about **TCO** [here](https://spanning.com/blog/total-cost-of-ownership-why-its-important-for-businesses/) and reflect a bit on your **own experience**\n","\n","<hr style=\"height:1px;border-width:0;color:#cfcfcf;background-color:#cfcfcf\">\n","\n","If you think a bit more about TCO, it appears similar to the scenarios below : \n","\n","* You are not an avid car enthusiast and only have **limited travel needs**. What should be your best decision in case you have a travel need?\n","\n","  **Buy a car** straight away or take  **car on rent** for your sporadic travel  needs?\n","\n","* When you get pizza cravings would you go to the grocery store to **purchase all raw materials**, come back home and **prepare the pizza** painstakingly or simply **ordering a pizza** on a food delivery app?\n","\n","The idea of **Cloud computing** is similar to the above 2 scenarios presented. Every **cloud service provider** is going to provide you a **catalog of services** available off the shelf which you can **rent out** and **pay only for what you use**. \n","\n","This means the below : \n","* Somebody else <u>owns the machines/services</u>\n","* Somebody else takes the <u>responsibility of maintenance</u>\n","* No need to hire<u> expensive staff</u>\n","* <u>Overall reduction in TCO</u>. You own the process, not the infrastructure\n","\n","**Wow!** Looks like this is **exactly what you are looking for**<img src=\"https://msklbusinessdata.blob.core.windows.net/website/imgs/emoji-wow.gif\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\"></img>\n","\n","<hr style=\"height:1px;border-width:0;color:#cfcfcf;background-color:#cfcfcf\">\n","\n","So, we started wondering if cloud is that **magic pill** that would kill ou IT headache all together?\n","\n","<img src=\"https://msklbusinessdata.blob.core.windows.net/website/imgs/celebrating.gif\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\"></img>\n","\n","<hr style=\"height:1px;border-width:0;color:#cfcfcf;background-color:#cfcfcf\">\n","\n","Well, as real as it gets, its <font color=\"#cc0000\">not that straight forwarded.</font> \n","\n","There are several **factors** which come together to decide the **level of dependency** an organization would like to have on the Cloud providers. \n","\n","* **Scenario 1 :** A company having an app which generates **humongous amount of data at high speeds** would need to write  their own distributed computing software and would only rent **inter-connected, bare metal hardware** hosted on a network of machines.  Ex. Uber, Amazon, Twitter \n","* **Scenario 2 :** A company having lot of **regulations around security and sensitivity of data**. Ex. Banks and Insurance companies. They simply can't put their databases on cloud straight away. They need to choose cautiously what applications they can **host on cloud** and what needs to **stay on-premise**\n","* **Scenario 3 :**. **New age startups** who would happily go for cloud services which keeps their **operating costs low**. If that means hosting their entire application as well as data on remote servers, they are fine with it. \n","\n","Considering the various kinds of dependency organizations would like to have on the cloud, leading service providers offer entire suite of services which could fit for most needs. \n","\n","These offerings come under the labels of **SaaS, PaaS, IaaS** etc. \n","\n","In order to best make sense of the above jargons, I would like you to have a look at the below image which explains which this brilliant analogy of pizza service. (**Credits : Albert Barron, IBM**)\n","\n","<img src=\"https://msklbusinessdata.blob.core.windows.net/website/imgs/pizza.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"400\"></img>\n","\n","Also, watch this easy to consume video to get a clear understanding of these terms :\n","\n","<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/biw25kM3qFA\"></iframe>\n","\n","(**Credits : [Bharti DW Consultancy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCifWfwxTfOYYoczCWmIY8bA)**)\n","\n","-------------------\n","\n","**Welcome back!**\n","\n","Hope, you can now connect to the **3 scenarios** I presented before. \n","\n","With Cloud offering a number of services ranging from networking to storage to computing and many more, **Traditional On-Premises** set up is fast vanishing out of the IT landscape. It makes perfect sense to have as less **CAPEX** (Capital Expenditure) as possible to stay lean.\n","\n","Moreover, depending upon the kind of services chosen by an organization, following would be the cost implication : \n","\n","* Organizations choosing for IaaS would end up paying the least to the cloud providers. All they are paying for is the hardware. \n","  Companies like Uber, Amazon would be a great fit for **IaaS** as they'll mostly need ready, connected and cheap commodity machines to build their solutions on\n","\n","* Organizations choosing for PaaS would end up paying for the usage of the platform for building solutions. This would be in addition to the infrastructure layer provided already as part of IaaS\n","New age startups like Myntra, Dunzo etc. may also go for **PaaS** as they build working data and deployment pipelines using services directly from AWS, Azure or GCP. \n","\n","* Organizations choosing for SaaS pay up the most as their entire application alongwith data and infrastructure is hosted on cloud infrastructure \n","\n","However, its not just the provisioning of various services makes cloud an appealing choice. There are a host of add-on services offered which takes away a lot of pain points in an enterprise set up. \n","\n","\n","\n","Following are the pain points I was talking about : \n","* Fault Tolerance : What if your on-premise set up is physically located at a single place? Any unwanted incident which causes disruption of the machines would lead to total black out of the application! In addition, back up & replication is another feature which cloud services provide to add resilience to the system\n","* Global Scalability : Your startup got recently funded with Series B and you are seeing accelerating global demand. How do you ensure your app gives the same smooth experience from every corner of the planet. You would need services which could auto replicate and auto scale. \n","* Enterprise grade Security : In today's world of frequent cyber attacks on systems and auditory compliances, organizations need to implement company wide authentication, authorization and license/certificate management systems. What if this is also offered by a cloud service provider?\n","\n","To summarize, Cloud computing services offered today provide a complete 360 degree solutions to build, scale and maintain highly resilient applications by helping you optimize what part you own and what you use as a service on rent. \n","\n","Psst!\n","\n","There is a big hidden reason which not many relate to. The barriers to exit. For Cloud computing solutions, both the barrier of entry and exit is low. The day the business shuts down, all you need to do is to shutdown the cloud services, archive/delete and exit. No charges from the next day!"]}]}
