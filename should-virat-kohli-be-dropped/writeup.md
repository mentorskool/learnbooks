### <font color="019aff">Problem Statement</font> 

<hr style="height:1px;border-width:0;color:#cfcfcf;background-color:#cfcfcf">

**SportsWiz** is a **sports tech** startup which provides data driven analysis and strategic recommendations to IPL franchises to help them answer a number of questions related to team's performance, composition and strategy

You are a **Data Analyst** hired by **SportsWiz** and you'll be working with the **Royal Challengers Bangalore** squad. 

The RCB Team has had many batting superstars like **Chris Gayle**, **AB de Villers** etc. but the one player which has always stood out is **Virat Kohli**. Ranking World no. 1 batsman for a long long time, Virat Kohli has made huge personal contributions towards the RCB batting camp.

The team management given the team's unimpressive performance in past IPLs is of the opinion that Virat Kohli needs to be dropped from the team. 

However, given the impressive past record by Virat, the batting coach is against the idea. 

He needs important milestones, performances of Virat as a proof to support his stand. 

Following are the **key questions** from the batting coach for you : 

* What **metrics** should I show to the management team to best help the cause of retaining Virat Kohli?
  * If we say Virat is **leading run-scorer** enough?
  * Will a mix of **run-rate**, **strike-rate** will help?
  * Any other **interesting metric** you can design? 

* Has he been a **predictable** player?
  * How **consistent** has his performance been compared to other batsmen in the RCB camp?
  * Any **outstanding** performances by him?

* Any season which you think Virat really **out-performed** his peers?
  * Which **IPL season** do you think he performed the best?
  * Was his performance in that season just a **random chance event** or was there really something **special** about his game?
